# My Navigation App

This repository is a school activity which I had to create a mobile app to train navigation between screens and async storage. The type of navigation used on this app was the stack.
The screens of the app are the login, profile, home and details screen. When you login, the login infomations and the status are saved. If you close the app before logout and open again,
you'll be redirected to the profile screen.
